            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-muted mb-6">My name is Sawyer, and I&apos;m a rising senior in <strong>Software Engineering</strong> at Cal State San Marcos. I helped run CSUSM&apos;s ACM and Cybersecurity Clubs, learned a lot, met great people, and picked up a few wins at hackathons and competitions.</p>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-muted mb-6">I build practical, secure products with the end user in mind. My current interests include <strong>Full-stack Development</strong>, <strong>Generative AI</strong>, and <strong>Blockchain</strong>.</p>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-muted mb-6">Software Engineering is my primary focus, but I also have supplementary skills in IT, Cybersecurity, Networking, Cloud Computing, Generative AI, etc. I can pretty much do anything if it involves a computer and I have source documentation or an internet connection.</p>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-muted mb-6">I enjoy sports, games, healthy competition, dabbling in the arts, and thinking about life.</p>
